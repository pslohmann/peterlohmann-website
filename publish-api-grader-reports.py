Copy the vendor grader reports into api-grader/reports/ so each vendor page can offer
its own markdown for download.

Redaction: the reports were written against LIVE accounts and a few name them.
Both repos are public, so a small list of account identifiers is replaced on the
way out. This touches identifiers only. No mark, score, category, finding or
sentence of reasoning is altered, and every substitution made is printed so it
can be checked against the source.

Run after a new report lands:

# entry recording vendor correspondence.

# of what was submitted. This suppression is applied on the way out, here, so a

#
# Applied on the way out, like SUPPRESS, so a rebuild cannot revert them. Each
# rule must match or the build aborts.
#
# Boom C5.3, corrected 2026-09-09. The run marked "not commercially gated" as
# partial while its own text established that no gate exists, withholding a pass
# because Boom publishes no pricing. The methodology does not ask for published
# pricing: C5.3 awards yes "when included or free", partial "when some meaningful
# capabilities are tier-gated", no "when the API requires a premium plan". No
# tier-gating was found. The one genuine gap, that the account owner could not
# confirm whether their access carried a fee, has since been answered by the
# operator: they were not charged extra, so access was included. Run 1 originally
# marked this yes; the correction restores that mark.
#
# Nothing else in the run changes. All other marks, the evidence and the findings
# stand; only the figures derived from C5.3 move.
