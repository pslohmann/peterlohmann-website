Builds the results table, the category jump pills, and the per-company detail
modals on api-grader/index.html, plus one page per platform in api-grader/.
LIVE SITE: pages are served at https://www.peterlohmann.com/api-grader/.
Run it from anywhere; paths are relative to this file.

WHY THIS EXISTS
    The scores appear in two places: the table cells and the pop-open modal.
    Hand-editing both is how they drift apart. This file is the single source of
    truth: edit DATA below, run `python3 build-api-grader.py`, and both are
    rewritten from the same numbers.

TO ADD A NEW GRADED COMPANY
    Find it in CATEGORIES (the name must match exactly), then add an entry to
    RESULTS keyed by that same name. Re-run this script. That is the whole job.

    Each RESULTS entry needs:
      score / grade   the published 0-100 number and its letter
      cats            five (points, max, plain-English note) tuples, in order
      strengths       short bullets, the good news
      watch           short bullets, the things that cost you work
      bottom          one paragraph, the verdict a PM should read
      meta            run date, methodology version, model, evidence tier

HOUSE RULE
    No em dashes or en dashes anywhere in the copy. Commas, parens, hyphens,
